# Access bundle compatibility

2026-09-22: JSON may be UTF-8 (with or without BOM), UTF-16 or UTF-32. Path entries also accept `raw_key` and strict SQLCipher `x'<hex>'` literals. Salt maps accept 64-hex keys or 96-hex key+salt; the appended salt must match the mapping key. Explicit passphrases are not silently treated as raw keys. Windows uses the Reader's private ACL policy, not POSIX mode bits.

Successful schema reads count independently of recognized WeChat tables. `unrecognized_readable_count` means decryption succeeded but classification did not; `verification_level=sqlite_schema_read` does not claim whole-database integrity. Scan truncation and errors remain in the verification result.

`rion-wechat-cli import-access` converts either of these user-supplied local JSON formats:

1. a path map whose non-metadata entries map database-relative paths to a hexadecimal key string or an object containing `enc_key`/`key`;
2. a schema-2 salt map containing `schema_version: 2` and `keys`, where each 32-hex database salt maps to its 64-hex post-PBKDF2 `enc_key`.

The path-to-`enc_key` convention is compatible with the Apache-2.0-licensed public project [huohuoer/wechat-cli](https://github.com/huohuoer/wechat-cli), version `0.2.4` at the time this compatibility layer was implemented. This repository does not copy, bundle, execute, or document that project's process-memory scanners, re-signing helpers, or bundled native key finder.

The salt-to-`enc_key` schema-2 convention is compatible with the MIT-licensed module [`github.com/r266-tech/wechat-cli`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/r266-tech/wechat-cli), version `v1.6.21`. Its public `internal/config` and `internal/wcdb` contracts define the map as the first 16 bytes of each encrypted database, encoded as 32 lowercase hex characters, to a 32-byte post-PBKDF2 key encoded as 64 hex characters. Only this published data contract was used in the Reader conversion layer; that layer does not invoke any acquisition tool. Separately, the optional [experimental access helper](../../../skills/wechat-cli/references/experimental-access.md) can explicitly invoke a user-supplied, reviewed wxkey build. No upstream acquisition implementation or binary is bundled.

Import is explicit. The command never searches another tool's state directory. The source must have `0600` permissions, every database path must remain inside `--database-root`, key values are never returned in command output, and the destination is written with `0600` permissions. Verification uses the local SQLCipher runtime against private snapshots before the destination file is committed.

Example with placeholders only:

```bash
chmod 600 /path/to/user-authorized-access.json
rion-wechat-cli import-access \
  --source /path/to/user-authorized-access.json \
  --keys-file ~/.config/rion-wechat-reader/keys.json \
  --pretty
```

For a schema-2 salt map, `db_root` is read from that explicitly supplied private file. A path map has no authoritative embedded root and must additionally provide `--database-root /path/to/authorized/db_storage`. After verification, the normalized root is retained only in the private `0600` destination bundle so a subsequent `setup --keys-file ...` can reuse it without another path argument.

The command supports conversion of access material the user already possesses. A schema-2 config can also be passed directly through an explicit `--keys-file` option. The CLI reads a database's 16-byte header salt, selects the matching entry, and uses SQLCipher's 96-hex raw-key form (`enc_key + salt`) against a private snapshot. It does not obtain, scan, recover, or derive database keys.
